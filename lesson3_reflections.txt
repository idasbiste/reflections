When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-> Whenever I want to turn my code public;
-> Whenever I want to have a remote copy of all my work (like a backup, for example)
-> When I want to have collaboration in a certain project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-> You can have code that is still not working. If it is pulled automatically you will be working over broken code and you don't want that.
